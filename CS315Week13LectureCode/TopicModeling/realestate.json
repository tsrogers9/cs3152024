Private clubs have long shaped the fabric of New York social life. Many of them formed during the Gilded Age, meticulously designed to be showstoppers before Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers surrounded them. But in recent years, a new wave of clubs has proliferated, varying in price point, exclusivity and amenities.", "Some people belong to multiple private clubs that have emerged to fill physical and emotional voids. Others belong only to Sam\u2019s Club. In a 115-year-old ferry terminal in New York\u2019s financial district, an abundance of excess now exists. Walls lined with Loro Piana cashmere, Brooklyn Bridge views, a wellness center, a jazz bar \u2014 all of it can be yours for $3,900 annually (or just $2,500, if you\u2019re under 30). Since it opened in 2021, Casa Cipriani has become one of the city\u2019s buzziest private clubs.", "A lease rental bond guarantee, which covers losses if a tenant fails to pay the rent, may seem unnecessary. But your landlord can require one. Q: A year ago, when I applied for a market-rate apartment in the Bronx, the landlord required that I get a lease rental bond from a bond company. I have a good credit score, but the agent said my liquid assets were below the required threshold. In addition to the bond, I had to give them first month\u2019s rent and a one-month security deposit before moving in. The bond cost me $1,000. I\u2019ve been paying my rent on time through the company\u2019s app, but now they\u2019re telling me that I need to renew the bond for a new two-year lease. I have signed the lease; the landlord has not. If I say no to the bond and can\u2019t work something else out, can I be evicted?"]
