Our newest addition to this esteemed company is Farideh Sadeghin\u2019s recipe for orange-glazed baked salmon. It\u2019s a no-fuss fish dinner with a clever, timesaving twist: Farideh builds a side salad into the recipe by tossing salad greens with some of the reserved honeyed orange juice that is used to flavor the salmon. If you\u2019re looking at the above image and thinking, \u201cI bet blood oranges would be especially beautiful and excellent in this recipe,\u201d know that Coco, a reader, already tried that and can confirm that the results were \u201cabsolutely delicious.\u201d", "It\u2019s a showstopping kaleidoscope of bulgogi, shiitakes, bean sprouts, spinach, carrots and cucumbers, all drizzled with a spicy gochujang sauce.

Some cutting-edge appliances like the air fryer may have risen in popularity lately, but the simple sheet pan has become as essential as a cast-iron skillet. In the past, the sheet pan was often called a rimmed baking sheet and used in kitchens to make the cake known as chocolate roulade; it\u2019s now all you need for a meal. New York Times Cooking lists nearly 1,000 sheet-pan recipes, many of them dinners. As Olga Massov and Sana\u00eb Lemoine demonstrate in their new, cheekily titled cookbook, \u201cHot Sheet,\u201d you can make just about anything but soup on a sheet pan. They take you through breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert using mainly half-sheets (18 by 13 inches) but also quarter sheets. They discuss materials but, oddly, never mention the issue of warping, which cheaper unreinforced pans are prone to do. The all-in-one recipes like fish over cabbage; chicken with olives, dates and preserved lemon; and also sheet-pan fried rice; roasted carrots; and granola, are the best. Though you can use a sheet pan to roast a whole chicken, duck or rack of lamb, other implements could do the job as well or better, especially when a recipe requires two sheet pans, which seems to miss the point. As for a clafoutis, a pie plate works just fine. Photos of well-used pans with their smudges of dark residue might resonate with home cooks.", "Higher prices? Fewer places?

To celebrate its arrival at the now-shuttered St. Ann\u2019s Church in Lower Manhattan, Rosa Cartagena and a team of women started a new tradition at the church: making and selling fanesca, a soup so labor-intensive that it is served for only a limited time during the Lenten season.", "The century-old club, in Helena, had a celebrated Black bartender and a membership of Montana\u2019s biggest movers and shakers.

Granted, I was born and raised in California, but I will always consider the roast chicken from Zuni Caf\u00e9, in San Francisco, to be the platonic ideal of a Fancy Chicken Dinner. So my Zuni senses were tingling when I saw Melissa Clark\u2019s new recipe for herby skillet chicken with greens. It hits all the necessary notes: crisp skin, tender meat, sturdy greens and scallions dressed in garlicky chicken drippings made just puckery enough with something acidic (in this case, lemon).", "Sweet potatoes with tahini butter, coconut saag and broccoli aligot are delicious at any age. This is Tejal, filling in for Tanya \u2014 hello! I\u2019ve missed you!

For many Jamaicans, spice bun is a staple of Lent, the 40-day period before Easter marked by prayer, penitence and restraint, for those observing.

I started buying eggs by the 30-pack in quarantine and never stopped. If there\u2019s eggs in the fridge, I can put dinner on the table: baked eggs, eggs kejriwal, kimchi eggs, romesco eggs.

But if you make biscuits today and do so again next weekend and the weekend after and the weekend after that, they will be terrific, the best biscuits ever.

Marigolds don\u2019t generally thrive in 30-degree weather. Yet on a cool March afternoon, they bloomed in golden bunches outside Bungalow, a new Indian restaurant in the East Village. The petals appeared perky and thriving, as did the man, Carlos Franqui, expertly twisting them into a colorful archway that crawled around the entrance.", "And plenty more minimum-effort, maximum-rewards dinner ideas. Hang on to your hats, because Hetty Lui McKinnon has done it again. Why do we all go so nuts for Hetty\u2019s recipes? Because she somehow manages to coax maximum character out of minimal ingredients, techniques and prep work. Her creations are always satisfying and never fussy, a true boon for busy people who care deeply about what they cook.", "This spring menu \u2014 a showstopping frittata, a snappy salad and a chewy cookie from a celebrated restaurant chef \u2014 isn\u2019t just surprising. It\u2019s surprisingly simple. No matter what\u2019s going on outside, by the end of March, it can be pretty much spring in the kitchen.

Add cassava to that wardrobe of tortillas. A new line, Coyotas, is an alternative to flour tortillas. It uses gluten-free organic cassava flour and organic coconut oil with only water and salt. The result behaves like flour tortillas, holds up well with fillings and comes in three sizes: small for tacos, medium for larger tacos and quesadillas, and large for burritos and other wraps. The company, based in San Diego, was started by Janet Flores Pavlovich, a native of Hermosillo in Sonora, in Northern Mexico, where the flour tortilla reigns. She learned to make them in her hometown and while she was at it, innovated by using cassava flour. And in one of those felicitous culinary accidents like the Toll House cookie, wound up with a gluten-free product. There are 12 in a pack of small, eight of medium and six of large; three packs for $37.50.", "Eric Kim\u2019s bacon and egg don is extremely delicious, and extremely simple. If you eat meat, or have ever eaten meat, then I probably don\u2019t need to mount an argument for bacon, a food so powerfully appealing that science has sought to explain the reasons why. Bacon is transformative in cooking, elevating other ingredients that share the bun, pan or plate. That, of course, includes eggs, which don\u2019t need bacon\u2019s help to be delicious, but become even more so in a New York-style breakfast sandwich or a bowl of spaghetti carbonara.", "A seafood bar opens above Claud, the former chef of Maharlika and Jeepney turns to Italian cuisine, and more restaurant news. It took Riccardo Giraudi, the Monte Carlo native with a global empire of Beefbars and other brands, 20 years to finally open a restaurant in New York. The TriBeCa space that had housed the original Nobu is now fitted with plush upholstery and 90 seats, an open kitchen and a separate bar area in the former Nobu Next Door. Mr. Giraudi, whose family has been in the wholesale meat business in Monaco since 1968 and whose restaurants in Europe showcase American beef with great success, is in partnership in the United States with Tribeca Hospitality Group, for which this is their first venture. \u201cIf this works we have a huge opportunity in the United States,\u201d said Aqib Rahman, who owns the group with other family members. Like many newly minted steakhouses, the owners insist this is \u201cnot a traditional steakhouse.\u201d But just like the others there\u2019s an emphasis on seafood. Other choices include items like a Black Angus kathi roll, Kobe beef gyozas, tuna rib-eye with shiso chimichurri, and Korean-style skirt steak. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense in just bringing American steaks back to New York,\u201d Mr. Giraudi said.

You can add almost any protein or vegetable to these and be guaranteed a dinner worth its weight in gold.", "Using canned artichokes and frozen peas keeps this fresh meal simple to make all year long.

There\u2019s always carrot maqluba, or a no-recipe recipe for kielbasa with pierogies. Good morning.

Good Friday!", "Whether for a casual cookout or an elegant dinner party, these impressive recipes are easy to pull off. After the quiet winter months, spring heralds the return of longer days and gathering over leisurely meals.

The property anchored the charity work she became known for: nursing sick people back to health in her house, giving needy people the clothes that hung in her closet, leading religious ceremonies in the church she helped build in the backyard and cooking dozens of meals every Sunday with staples like fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, candied yams and a favorite of the congregation, chew bread.", "Are you team raisins or no raisins? On the subject of raisins in carrot cake, the food writer Allison Robicelli once wrote for Taste Cooking, \u201cThey don\u2019t just get to show up in desserts, acting like they belong there when they have no business stepping outside of the world of trail mix.\u201d", "Deviled eggs, for sure. Maybe pickled eggs, cured with beets, vinegar and sugar, too? Good morning. I had a lovely run of Brooklyn sandwiches going, before work, school and Easter intervened to send me back to the kitchen.
