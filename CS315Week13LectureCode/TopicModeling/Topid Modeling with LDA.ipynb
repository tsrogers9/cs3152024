The kindest thing you can do for yourself when you’re stiff from being in the cold is to find some warmth: Because as the chill in your bones starts to fade, so does your stiffness. The same thing happens to hard winter vegetables when they’re enveloped in the heat of the oven — they soften and sweeten as they roast until they’re golden outside and tender in the middle.\n",

Good morning. The vernal equinox is in less than three weeks, but you wouldn’t know it from the frosted mud in the woods and the storm-wounded lawns where I stay. It’s bare ugly everywhere save in the bays, where water clear as gin flows over rocks in a spectrum of pink. At the market: cabbage and potatoes, a box of turnips, industrial berries that might have been grown in space. The new season’s coming, sure as tulips, but right now it’s hard to imagine.\n",
       "food_3  Just add rice or potatoes (and maybe a chilled white wine). Citrus and salmon is a winning combination, previously proven in New York Times Cooking’s recipes for broiled salmon with mustard and lemon, roasted salmon with ginger-lime butter and citrusy roasted salmon and potatoes. Our newest addition to this esteemed company is Farideh Sadeghin’s recipe for orange-glazed baked salmon. It’s a no-fuss fish dinner with a clever, timesaving twist: Farideh builds a side salad into the recipe by tossing salad greens with some of the reserved honeyed orange juice that is used to flavor the salmon. If you’re looking at the above image and thinking, “I bet blood oranges would be especially beautiful and excellent in this recipe,” know that Coco, a reader, already tried that and can confirm that the results were “absolutely delicious.”\n",

Good morning. On Sunday, I like a project in the kitchen more than on any other day. It’s a chance to work at the stove without the need to get something on the table in 45 minutes, a time to stretch my skill set. Mostly, it’s an opportunity to explore recipes rather than simply following them. On Sundays I don’t want to fly by wire. I want to fly.\n",

In the third installment of her YouTube series, Cooking 101, the chef and cookbook author Sohla El-Waylly will help you master the basics of the bird, then set you up with a handful of recipes that highlight white and dark meat.   \n",

      "In the third installment of her YouTube series, the cookbook author and chef Sohla El-Waylly will teach you how to master the basics of the bird. For beginners and experienced cooks alike, preparing chicken can come with a lot of questions (and nerves!). Am I going to get salmonella? How do I butcher a whole bird? Am I doomed to an eternity of dry breast meat? In the third installment of her YouTube series, Cooking 101, the chef and cookbook author Sohla El-Waylly will help you master the basics of the bird, then set you up with a handful of recipes that highlight white and dark meat.\n",
      "Sip teas inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, learn to cook the cuisine of Punjab and more food news. Some cutting-edge appliances like the air fryer may have risen in popularity lately, but the simple sheet pan has become as essential as a cast-iron skillet. In the past, the sheet pan was often called a rimmed baking sheet and used in kitchens to make the cake known as chocolate roulade; it’s now all you need for a meal. New York Times Cooking lists nearly 1,000 sheet-pan recipes, many of them dinners. As Olga Massov and Sanaë Lemoine demonstrate in their new, cheekily titled cookbook, “Hot Sheet,” you can make just about anything but soup on a sheet pan. They take you through breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert using mainly half-sheets (18 by 13 inches) but also quarter sheets. They discuss materials but, oddly, never mention the issue of warping, which cheaper unreinforced pans are prone to do. The all-in-one recipes like fish over cabbage; chicken with olives, dates and preserved lemon; and also sheet-pan fried rice; roasted carrots; and granola, are the best. Though you can use a sheet pan to roast a whole chicken, duck or rack of lamb, other implements could do the job as well or better, especially when a recipe requires two sheet pans, which seems to miss the point. As for a clafoutis, a pie plate works just fine. Photos of well-used pans with their smudges of dark residue might resonate with home cooks.\n",
      "Ali Slagle’s new carbonara-leaning skillet pasta with bacon and eggs is a quick and easy meal for any time of day. When I’m tired and hungry and there’s nothing promising in the fridge save for a half-dozen eggs, there’s always breakfast for dinner. Scrambled eggs on toast or a crisper-clearing frittata are dependable, self-assuring standbys. And if I also have a couple of strips of bacon, a generous scoop of orzo and a bit of Parmesan, there’s skillet pasta with bacon and eggs, a brilliant new recipe from Ali Slagle. It’s quick, easy and a little luxe — the runny egg yolks mingle with the bacony, cheesy pasta to create a carbonara-leaning one-pot meal. Eat this for Friday dinner with a handful of arugula on the side (for “health”), or for Sunday breakfast with sliced oranges and never-ending coffee.\n",
      "Take a tiny vacation in the middle of your day. Back in 2016, shortly after I joined the magazine Bon Appétit as an assistant editor, two of the top editors treated me to lunch. They decided on Augustine, the short-lived, four-dollar-sign Keith McNally restaurant on the ground floor of the Beekman hotel in the financial district.\n",
      "During the quarantine, a couple worked hard on an application for the city’s housing lottery, and their efforts paid off: a two-bedroom for $1,241 a month in Long Island City. When the pandemic began, Susannah Dalton and José Ignacio Vivero were living in a basement apartment in Sunnyside, Queens. “It wasn’t bad during Covid,” Ms. Dalton said, “because it had a strong bunker feel and that was the vibe back then. This was back in the early days when we were, like, Windexing groceries.”\n",
      "As long as this dog isn’t biting people, it’s probably not going anywhere. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you have to live with the noise. Q: My husband and I have lived in a co-op in Westchester County for 37 years. It’s a three-story building that prohibits dogs as pets, and we’ve always had a great relationship with the other residents. But nine months ago, our upstairs neighbors acquired an emotional support dog for their teenager. The dog runs back and forth for 30 minutes at a time. At least three nights a week, it scratches a bedroom rug, waking us up throughout the night. We have shared our concerns with the neighbors, asking them to crate the dog at night and walk him when he’s rambunctious. They seemed receptive, but the problem persists. How can we balance the rights of people to have emotional support animals with our right to live peacefully?\n",
      "Some people belong to multiple private clubs that have emerged to fill physical and emotional voids. Others belong only to Sam’s Club. In a 115-year-old ferry terminal in New York’s financial district, an abundance of excess now exists. Walls lined with Loro Piana cashmere, Brooklyn Bridge views, a wellness center, a jazz bar — all of it can be yours for $3,900 annually (or just $2,500, if you’re under 30). Since it opened in 2021, Casa Cipriani has become one of the city’s buzziest private clubs.\n"
