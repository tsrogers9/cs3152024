When Kevin Bacon noted on Instagram that his morning habits are like those of a Neanderthal, he did not stop to explain that our ancient cousins interbred with modern humans expanding out of Africa.", "Two spacecraft have ended up askew on the lunar surface this year. It is easier to tip over in the weaker gravity on the moon than you may imagine. When the robotic lander Odysseus last month became the first American-built spacecraft to touch down on the moon in more than 50 years, it toppled over at an angle. That limited the amount of science it could do at the lunar surface, because its antennas and solar panels were not pointed in the correct directions.", "A new study suggests that the amount of the element on the moon of Jupiter is on the lower end of previous estimates.

Still, female elephant seals are absolutely dwarfed by their male counterparts, which are typically at least three times heavier.", "A new study argues that the change brought these females an evolutionary advantage \u2014 and perhaps did the same for humans. Menopause is all too familiar to women, but in other species it\u2019s remarkably rare.
